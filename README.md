## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks wallet
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `clarinet install`
3. Deploy contract: `clarinet deploy`

### Basic Usage

1. Create a band group:
```clarity
(contract-call? .band-shared-financials create-group "Awesome Band")
```

2. Add band members:
```clarity
(contract-call? .band-shared-financials add-member group-id member-address)
```

3. Record a financial entry:
```clarity
;; Record an income entry with equal allocation
(contract-call? .band-shared-financials record-financial-entry 
  group-id 
  "Spotify Royalties" 
  u1000 
  tx-sender 
  "income" 
  u0 
  "equal"
)
```

## Function Reference

### Group Management
```clarity
(create-group (name (string-ascii 100)))
(add-member (group-id uint) (new-member principal))
(update-member-allocation (group-id uint) (member principal) (allocation-bps uint))
```

### Financial Entry Management
```clarity
(record-financial-entry 
  (group-id uint) 
  (name (string-ascii 100)) 
  (amount uint) 
  (paid-by principal) 
  (entry-type (string-ascii 20)) 
  (recurrence-period uint) 
  (allocation-type (string-ascii 10))
)
```

### Payment Settlement
```clarity
(settle-payment (group-id uint) (to-member principal) (amount uint))
```

## Security Considerations

- Maximum 20 members per group
- Strict access controls
- Transparent allocation mechanisms
- Immutable financial records

### Best Practices
- Verify group member balances before settlements
- Set accurate financial entry allocations
- Double-check payment amounts
- Keep detailed financial records

## Development

### Testing
1. Run tests: `clarinet test`
2. Local development: `clarinet console`
